Latest versions of datasets could be find in the shared google drive folder.

# Objectives

- This process identifies the occupations that were wrongly merged with address information. Used substring matching and fuzzy name match algorithm to find appropriate occupations.

- Then all the occupations from different directories were combined and used aglomerative clustering and affinity propogation algorithms to standardize the occupations

# Methodology 

- Identify the occupations that were wrongly merged with address information- substring matching and fuzzy name matching algorithm were used to find appropriate occupation
